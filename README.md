This is the source code used for the experimental part of the paper 
			On the Cost of Demographic Parity in Influence Maximization published at AAAI-23

For execution of the experiments use
    python main_dp.py experiment_type N

where experiment_type is one of
        [   
	    
	    'ba-singletons-0_0.4-200',
            'ba-singletons-0_0.4-100',
            'ba-singletons-0_0.4-50',
            'tsang-region-gender-0-0.4',
            'irvine_0_0.2_bfs_comm_10',
            'email-Eu-core_0_0.2',
            'ca-GrQc_0_0.2-leiden',
            'ca-HepTh_0_0.2_random-n_10',
            'facebook_combined_0_0.2_bfs_comm_2',
            ]
and N is the number of experiments that are supposed to be run in parallel.

For creating the instances use
    python main_generate.py experiment_type


- For creating the networks used by Fish et al. [1] download the data sets into a subfolder 'fish' and put it into the folder 'data_set'.

- For running tests on the networks used by Tsang et al. [2], download the instances into the subfolder 'networks' and put it into the folder 'tsang'.

- The files have the following content:
    - main_dp.py: contains the infrastructure for the execution of the experiments.
    - generation.py: contains the functions that generate the different instances.
    - influence_max.py: contains the necessary implementations of influence maximization functions: computation of the influence sigma of a set (and related functions sigma_v, sigma_C, see the paper), computation of nodes reachable from a given set, generation of live edge graphs, greedy algorithms for influence maximization and maximin
    - maximin_fish.py: contains the implementations of the myopic routine of Fish et al.
    - gurobi_influence_max.py: contains the implementations of the milp of Farnadi et al. [3]
    - main_generate.py: contains the infrastructure for generating the instances used in the paper.
    - print_functions.py: contains some functions for prettier printing of graphs etc.
    - tsang_maximin.py: contains the function used to call the code of Tsang et al. [2]
    - cpp_proxy.py: contains the functions for executing the c++ implementations, the algorithms proposed in the paper and the multiplicative weight routine of Young [4] for the set-based problem of Becker et al.[5].

- Folder 'TIM_final' contains the c++ implementation of the proposed algorithms in the paper. It uses TIM implementation for influence maximization [6].
- The execution generates an output file within the folder 'results_dp' with the name being the experiment_type.


- The experiment_types have the following meaning, see the paper for the interpretation of the community structure types:
